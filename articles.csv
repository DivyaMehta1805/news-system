This marks a big step forward in efforts to meet a Supreme Court order - that democracy return to Jammu and the Kashmir Valley by September 30. In Srinagar last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had saidan election will be held soon and that statehood would be restored. In preparation for the election, the EC said, the final voter list would be published by August 20, the day after the Amarnath Yatra ends. Around 87 lakh voters, he said, are expected to vote. The EC alsodismissed suggestions the election will cross the top court's deadlineby four days.  ""The people want change... they want to script a new future,"" Election Commission chief Rajiv Kumar said, as he outlined the poll body's plans to hold a safe and successful election in J&K. ""We recently visited J&K to take stock of election preparation. Great enthusiasm was seen... people want to participate in the process. People want elections as early as possible..."" he said, recalling the ""long queues"" at polling booths in J&K and Ladakh during the Lok Sabha election.

Glimpse of hope and democracy shows the people want to change the picture... they want to write their own destiny. The people chose ballots over bullets..."" he declared. An EC team led by Mr Kumar visited J&K for two days earlier this month, during which time they met with representatives from political parties as well as senior police and security officials. And, hours before today's dates announcement, there had been a large-scale reshuffle of senior police officers, including district chiefs and the head of J&K Police's Intelligence unit. READ |Big Reshuffle In J&K Police Ahead Of Poll Announcement The reshuffle, questioned by opposition parties like the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party, also came as several districts in Jammu face increased terror attacks. That was the third visit by the EC since 2019; the two earlier visits were related to the 2019 and 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Both times the poll panel declined to hold simultaneous elections. Meanwhile, National Conference leader and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah welcomed the election dates but flagged concerns over the reshuffle of senior police officers in the region. ""After 1987-88 this is probably for the first time an election is happening in phases... it will be a new experience. For National Conference, I can say we have been preparing..."" he said this afternoon.

Meanwhile, the BJP's J&K in-charge, Tarun Chugh, said, ""The announcement of dates is worth welcoming... under leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, J&K had become free of Article 370. People have faith in PM Modi... BJP will fight elections in J&K..."" In December last year the top court had directed the Election Commission to hold Assembly polls by September 30 of this year.

The political slugfest over the grisly killing of a doctor at Kolkata'sRG Kar Medical College and Hospitalramped up Friday evening after Bengal Chief MinisterMamata Banerjeereiterated claims the CPIM and BJP, unlikely allies, orchestrated violence and vandalism at the institution early Thursday. Ms Banerjee - at the centre of crosshairs as the Chief Minister and in-charge of the Home and Health ministries - accused the rivals of trying to obscure the truth behind the rape and murder. ""We want the truth to come out but some are spreading lies to mislead people. Attempts are being made to hide the truth by circulating fake news on social media. We condemn these activities. We want the culprits to be punished,"" the Chief Minister said at a rally in Kolkata.  ""The nexus between the Left and BJP should be exposed.CPIM and BJP are behind the vandalism of RG Kar Hospital. They vandalised the hospital to destroy evidence..."" she claimed. ""Left and BJP want to create unrest in Bengal... they have come together to do this. The people who vandalised the Hospital are outsiders... I have seen many videos,"" the Chief Minister alleged, declaring people could be seen holding BJP and CPIM party flags in those videos. The BJP has counterattacked by trying to invert Ms Banerjee's narrative, claiming it was her party, in fact, that sponsored the attack on the hospital. ""Mamata Banerjee sent goons to the apolitical rally near RG Kar Hospital. They were given safe passage by police, who either ran off or looked the other way,"" Suvendu Adhikari, once Ms Banerjee's close aide, said on X.

The Trinamool is also a member of that bloc, although the relationship between itself and the Left party and the Congress is fragile. The three failed, quite spectacularly and publicly, to find common ground while discussing seat-sharing during the April-June Lok Sabha election, resulting in the INDIA bloc fielding candidates against Ms Banerjee. The BJP, though, couldn't capitalise on this rift, losing to the Trinamool. On Wednesday Ms Banerjee also snapped at the Congress, hours after Rahul Gandhi's acerbic comment about the handling of the case by the ""local administration"".

Mr Gandhi had earlier said ""the attempt to save the accused, instead of providing justice to the victim, raises serious questions about the hospital and local administration"". The Chief Minister and her government have been under heavy fire since the doctor's body was found in a seminar room of the hospital on August 9. The doctors' parents have made multiple allegations against hospital administration and the police, prompting the Calcutta High Court to overrule the Chief Minister's seven-day deadline to the cops and hand the case to the CBI. The CBI has since also been directed to submit an interim report into the vandalism; the court this morning demanded to know how the police allowed a mob of 7,000 to gather. READ |""Prove With Pics Crime Scene Intact"": Court To Bengal Over Hospital Vandalism Kolkata Police have repeatedly and firmly denied any impropriety on their part, insisting their investigation was conducted in accordance with the rules and in a transparent manner. They have, though, admitted to an ""assessment failure"" with regard to the hospital vandalism. READ |""Assessment Failure"": Kolkata Police Commissioner On Vandalism At Hospital The police have also pointed to 25 arrests made in connection with the vandalism. However, in comments that may upset Ms Banerjee's claims, the cops said many of those arrested said ""they came on their own"".

Ms Banerjee has defended the state police force, pointing out they had collected forensic evidence, recorded statements, conducted an autopsy, and arrested a suspect within days.

The High Court has taken notice of these protests and demanded that the state government provide better protection to doctors and healthcare workers.

In 2019, the BJP had won 40 seats and formed the government with Dushyant Chautala's JJP (10 seats). But the alliance ended earlier this year with a change of guard in the BJP as Mr Saini replaced ML Khattar as the Chief Minister. The Congress ended up in the opposition with 31 seats.

"""Assessment Failure"": Kolkata Police Commissioner On Vandalism At Hospital",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assessment-failure-kolkata-police-commissioner-on-vandalism-at-hospital-6350474#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll,"The commissioner strongly defended the police's investigation into the rape and murder. Hours after the Calcutta High Court pulled up the West Bengal government and the police over the vandalism of the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where a trainee doctor was brutally raped and murdered last week, Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal has admitted that there was an ""assessment failure"". Women in Kolkata and many other parts of the country had organised a vigil, calling it 'women, reclaim the night' on Wednesday. During the vigil, which began around 11 pm, some people entered the premises of the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and went on a rampage. Vehicles were attacked, public property was damaged and the police had to resort to a lathicharge as well as firing teargas shells to control the situation. The Kolkata Police said 15 policemen were injured and 25 people have been arrested so far.  On Friday, when Mr Goyal was asked about the vandalism and why it couldn't be prevented, he said, ""It was a leaderless crowd, anticipating and assessing how many people would gather in one place was difficult. We had to spread ourselves thin. There were many women there and we had to keep their safety in mind; some of the people who have been arrested include women. So we had to be restrained in our response. We could not be using force left, right and centre, just like that. There was sufficient deployment and officers were there, trying to keep the crowd in check."" ""Despite that, the barricade was breached and people got into the hospital and vandalised the place. We have 15 people who were injured badly,"" the police commissioner added. Mr Goyal, however, strongly defended the police's investigation into the rape and murder and accused ""so-called experts"" of creating narratives. ""Far too many rumours are floating around, which have no basis. And, based on these, so-called experts are trying to say that Kolkata Police has not done this, or it was a gang-rape by so many people. Evidence has to be scientific in nature. The case is now with the CBI, let's trust the agency investigating the case. They will also come up with evidence. Whatever we had to do in whatever little time we had was done,"" he said. Mr Goyal said the CBI would find out if there was any destruction of evidence by the Kolkata Police and the force would be liable for legal action if there was anything that was done wrong. ""Why are people so impatient? Have faith in the new investigating agency. Why is this rumour-mongering going on... Our officers are cooperating with the agency. We have tried to be as transparent as possible,"" he stressed. How Will Doctors Work Fearlessly?
